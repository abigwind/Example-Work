    "I'm starting from code that I made for an analysis of Men's Euro's 2024 Cup, and working from there. I've changed some of the info to clean up the flow as well as added something I heard Julie Foudy talking about in teh last USA match against Germany--the time between matches was ridiculous in terms of turnaround for the teams. Also, that the teams were having to travel so much. So I've included some analysis of time between games for teams as well as how far they had to travel. Should be interesting!!"
